# mini_project_repo

This is a 'skeleton' repository that is being used for the purposes of
completing a repository-based mini-project in From Data to Manuscript in
R. There are no specific research questions that I am testing in
preparation for my final project.

All of the data in the repository are artificial and do not contain any
information about real people (other than one question using information
about myself). Any overlaps between this repository's data and real
people are merely coincidental. The data are just being used to complete
objectives from the objective list.

All 'csv' output has been saved to the 'Tables' folder located within
the main repository. The 'Skeleton.Rproj' and 'skeleton_repo.qmd' files
in the main repository are all that are required to successfully run the
code. The 'skeleton_repo_files' folder contains information related to
rendering the code into a Markdown document, in addition to figures that
were generated in the code.
