# mini_project_repo

This is a 'skeleton' repository that is being used for the purposes of
completing a repository-based mini-project in From Data to Manuscript in
R.

All of the data in the repository are artificial and do not contain any
information about real people. Any overlaps between this repository's
data and real people are merely coincidental.

All 'csv' output has been saved to the 'Tables' folder located within
the main repository. The 'Skeleton.Rproj' and 'skeleton_repo.qmd' files
in the main repository are all that are required to successfuly run the
code. The 'skeleton_repo_files' folder contains information related to
rendering the code into a Markdown document.
