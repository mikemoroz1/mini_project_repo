# mini_project_repo
This is a 'skeleton' repository that is being used for the purposes of completing a repository-based mini-project in From Data to Manuscript in R.

All of the data in the repository are artificial and do not contain any information about real people. Any overlaps between this repository's data and real people are merely coincidental.

All 'csv' output has been saved to the 'Tables' folder located within the main repository. The 'Skeleton.Rproj' and 'skeleton_repo.qmd' files in the main repository are all that are required to successfuly run the code. The 'skeleton_repo_files' folder contains information related to rendering the code into a Markdown document.
